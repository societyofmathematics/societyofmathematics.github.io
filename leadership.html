		<h2>Skyler Marks</h2>
		<h3>President</h3>
		<p>
		I'm Skyler, a fourth year Undergraduate student in Mathematics. I
		have a strong love for abstract math, and firmly believe that the concepts treated in upper
		level math courses can and should be made accessable to everyone. As president of the
		Society of Mathematics, my goal is to foster a sort of coffeehouse discussion driven by
		individual interest and passion, where ideas and knowledge are shared and everyone comes
		away having learned and enjoyed themselves. </p><p>
		My interests lie mainly in pure algebraic geometry, extending to complex algebraic geometry,
		and commutative algebra / homological algebra. In the next few years I'm hoping to expand my
		knowledge of derived geometry, intersection theory, and stacks / moduli spaces, but I can't
		honestly say I know much about that yet. I also nurse a passing interest in low dimensional
		topology and homotopy theory, and try to keep up with what's going on in physics.
		</p><p>Please
		feel free to send questions or thoughts about math or the club itself to <a href="mailto:skyler@bu.edu">skyler@bu.edu</a>. </p>

		<h2>Zoe Siegelnickel</h2>
		<h3>Vice President</h3>
		<p>I am a Junior, but this is my second year at BU (I’m a transfer student). I am the vice
		president of the Society of Math, and help organize the weekly meetings and any other events
		we host. I am interested in mathematical physics, specifically QFT, but I enjoy most things
		that are in some way algebraic. You can reach me at 
		<a href="mailto:z0e@bu.edu">z0e@bu.edu</a>

		<h2>Zach Zobair</h2>
		<h3>Head of the Colloquium</h3>
		<p>
		My name is Zach and I am in my fifth year at BU doing the BA/MA program in pure
		mathematics. In the Society of Mathematics, I am the head of the undergraduate colloquium,
		and so I organize
		those talks, as well as helping out with our weekly society meetings! I love sharing
		mathematics with people who are also super interested in math, and I think the colloquium is
		a great avenue for that. My interests in math lie broadly in things which feel algebraic.
		Recently I have been enjoying some algebraic number theory. You can reach me at <a 
	href="mailto:zzobair@bu.edu">zzobair@bu.edu</a>.

		<h2>Iker Perez</h2>
		<h3>Treasurer</h3>
		<p>	Hey! I’m Iker, a sophomore studying Mathematics, Computer Science, and Sociology at
		Boston University. My biggest interest in math is model-making and algorithms, specifically
		as they relate to improving and observing the social world. I am the treasurer for the
		Society of Mathematics, so I’m in charge of dealing with our budget and spending, so if
		you’re dealing with something related to that, I’m your guy! I’m not completely sure what
		sort of super-high-level math interests me yet, but that’s alright, the world is my oyster!
		I invite you to come and keep exploring math and what it has to offer with me and the other
		members of the club. You can also reach me at <a href="mailto:isperez@bu.edu">isperez@bu.edu</a>.</p>
