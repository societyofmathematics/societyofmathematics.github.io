	<p>
The BU Society of Mathematics Colloquium is a venue for students studying (and interested in) mathematics to give talks on topics of their choice to a general math audience. We will have colloquia bi-weekly on Tuesdays at 6:30. There will be a 15-minute tea (and snacks) before the talks begin. We ask that talks will be in the range of 30-60 minutes, but this is by no means strict (of course don't go too far over/under). Speakers will be asked to provide notes for their talk typeset in LaTeX to be included in a proceedings-style publication at the end of the semester.
</p><p>
We ask that topics of talks be accessible to, say, a student who has taken the calculus sequence and
seen some linear algebra. However, this is not a strict requirement and will consider colloquium
talk proposals on a case-by-case basis. If you're interested in presenting, please contact Zach in
<a href="https://discord.gg/5WAmZ9RA">our discord</a> or email him at <a

<h3>
Smoothness of the Area Feature Function
</h3>
<h4>Hunter Golemon</h4>
Does the area of the level set of a real valued function of two real variables vary smoothly as the
function is moved around? In order to understand this question, we must first understand why we
would want to ask it. This question arose from studying zebrafish pattern formation, where they took
level sets of functions to generate patterns. They made a gene parameter space to vary the “genes”
of the fish, and then drew curves in this parameter space to separate regions containing spots from
stripes. However, to draw these curves, we needed the area of a level set to be smooth in the
function space. We will learn about the derivative as a linear map, the Implicit Function Theorem,
and then prove the area of a pattern varies smoothly in the infinite dimensional vector space of
functions.

<h3>
An Introduction to the Theory of p-Adic Numbers and Local Fields
</h3>
<h4>Zach Zobair</h4>
First introduced by Kurt Hensel in 1897, for a fixed prime p, the p-adic numbers are a completion of
the rational numbers, similar to the real numbers, but with respect to a different sense of
"distance" between two rational numbers. They are an example of a nonarchimedean local field. In
this talk we will begin by constructing the p-adic numbers and exploring some of their analytic,
algebraic, and topological properties, as well as remarking on how these properties manifest for
general local fields (<bf>Part 1</bf>). From there, we will shift perspectives and provide a geometric
intuition as to how, if one's goal is to solve a Diophantine equation, the p-adic numbers naturally
arise as a correct setting in which to do this (<bf>Part 2</bf>). For (<bf>Part 1</bf>), minimal prerequisites are
necessary. For full rigour some results will be stated in terms of fields, rings, and ideals, but
for a general understanding and intuition one can take these on faith. In (<bf>Part 2<bf>), we will assume
the basics of algebraic geometry (essentially just the definition of a locally ringed space).

<h3><a href="braids.pdf">An Introduction to Braid Groups</a></h3>
<h4>Olivia Hu</h4>
A braid in math is not too far from how it sounds — a collection of strands interlacing and
intertwining as they travel through paths in space. These braids are interesting creatures in their
own right. Some braids look complex, but are just one twist from being untied; other braids can look
simple, but are in truth much more obstinate. However, the study takes an unexpected turn upon
discovering braids, like numbers, can be multiplied and divided to create new braids: they form an
abstract structure called a group. By studying this group, we will realize that in studying braids,
we are actually also studying continuous functions on a disk.

<h3>CW-Complexes and Related Topics</h3>
<h4>Alice Marchant</h4>
Imagine building a tower. You have to start with some sort of foundation and then build a layer up
and then another layer on top of that and so on. A CW complex is a way that we can do this same
building process but for (almost) any space you can think of by just adding <em>n</em>-disks to a
previous part. We will explore in more detail how this construction works, some of the constraints
on it, and why it is such a useful construction in algebraic topology.

<h3><a href = "Conics.pdf">An Invitation to Algebraic Geometry</a></h3>
<h4>Skyler Marks</h4>
In high school algebra 1 and 2, we study the theory of single variable polynomial equations. In
	linear algebra, we study systems of linear equations, or polynomial equations with no exponents
	greater than 1. Algebraic Geometry combines these disciplines to study polynomial equations (in
	particular, their solutions) in many variables. This theory is useful as it is specific enough
	that we can compute with it, yet general enough that it applies to many problems we care about.
	The promised invitation will be extended by way of plane conics and cubics. After some
	definitions and preliminaries, we will review a family of classical results regarding plane
	conics (quadratic polynomials in two variables). We will begin by classifying conics into
	families who’s members are “alike”. We will then leverage this classification to study the
	intersections of two conics. Our conclusion to this first act will be a detailed discussion of
	the number of conics passing through n points in the plane, introducing Moduli spaces and
	projective space.

<h3><a href = "Weyl_Groups-1.pdf">Root Systems and Lie Groups</a></h3>
<h4>Zoe Siegelnickel</h4><br>
A root system is a collection of vectors definied over a Euclidian vector space with certain
	geometric properties. Some of the isometries
generated by these roots form a group called a Weyl group. These groups are
used extensively to study various symmetries. We will do a brief introduction
to Euclidean space, isometries, and root systems before discussing Weyl groups
and Weyl chambers and how they appear in Lie Theory.

<h3><a href = 'elliptic-curves.pdf'>Elliptic Curve Cryptography</a></h3>
<h4>Skyler Marks</h4>
The digital world is kept secure by cryptography. The idea behind most
modern cryptographic systems is that if I have a public number (some sort of
seed) and a secret number (usually called a private key) I can perform some
operation with them to generate a third number (which usually called a public
key). The public key is easy to generate by combining a seed and a private key,
but hard to generate any other way; this allows us to verify the authenticity of a
private key very easily. One such operation involves finding collinear points on
an elliptic curve, giving rise to elliptic curve cryptography. This talk introduced
elliptic curves over finite fields, explained how we can use their geometry to define
an appropriate operation, and touched on why this operation is appropriate
for cryptography. Slides for the talk can be found <a href="slides.pdf">here</a>.
