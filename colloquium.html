<div class="col-info">
	<p>
The Society of Mathematics Colloquium is a venue for students studying
(and interested in) mathematics to give talks on topics of their
choice to a general math audience. We will have colloquia weekly on
Mondays at 6:30. We ask that talks be in the range of 60
minutes. Speakers will be asked to provide notes for their talk
typeset in LaTeX to be included in a proceedings-style publication at
the end of the semester.
</p><p>
We ask that topics of talks be accessible to, say, a student who has
taken the calculus sequence and seen some linear algebra. However,
this is not a strict requirement and will consider colloquium talk
proposals on a case-by-case basis. If you're interested in presenting,
please contact Zach in <a href="https://discord.gg/5WAmZ9RA">our
discord</a> or email him
at <a href="mailto:zzobair@bu.edu">zzobair@bu.edu</a>.

<h3>
 Lattice Isomorphism Theorem
</h3>
<h4>Molly Roughan</h4>
Quotient constructions appear throughout algebra. In linear algebra,
they arise from kernels of linear maps. In group theory, they arise from
normal subgroups. The Lattice Isomorphism Theorem (also called the
fourth Isomorphism Theorem) describes how subgroup structure behaves
under quotients. This talk builds upon existing intuition for the theorem,
illustrates it through examples in Z and the dihedral groups, and concludes
with some interesting applications of the theorem.

<h3>
 Sheaf Cohomology
</h3>
<h4>Skyler Marks</h4>
Sheaves are universally present in modern geometry, from the most
abstract and esoteric arithmetic and algebraic geometry to the most
concrete differential geometry. They allow us to capture, in a very
flexible way, the notion of various types of "functions on a
space". For example, we can capture the idea of "differentials" or the
"tangent space" to a shape using sheaves. In this talk we will explain
the cohomology theory related to sheaves, and give some examples of
computations therewith. We'll also see some of the cohomology theories
we've been introduced to in the past appear as sheaf cohomology!

<h3>
  Abelian Categories
</h3>
<h4>Grant Talbert</h4>
The theory of abelian categories arose as an axiomatization of
homological algebra. In this talk, we will define abelian categories,
and then construct homology and derived functors in the more general,
categorical setting they provide.

<h3>
Homology and Cohomology in Mathematical Physics
</h3>
<h4>Zoe Siegelnickel</h4>
In this talk, we will take a quick tour of some of the places that
cohomology shows up in physics, and discuss why it's a useful tool in
physics, as well as in math.
</subsection>

<subsection>
<h3>
Simplicial Cohomology
</h3>
<h4>Alice Marchant</h4>
In this talk we will be covering a geometric way to view homological
algebra. In some way, we will be going over what motivated the subject
in the first place. We will begin by seeing that the idea of a “hole”
can be captured using an algebraic invariant coming from homological
algebra and then doing some computations of this invariant for some
spaces.
</subsection>


<subsection>
<h3>
Cohomology as Measuring Obstruction
</h3>
<h4>Zach Zobair</h4>
This talk will be an overview of how we can see cohomology as
"measuring obstruction", with an overview of some basic category
theory and abstract algebra. Group theory and group cohomology will
provide the setting for most of the examples.

<h3>
Homological Algebra: Preliminaries
</h3>
<h4>Skyler Marks</h4>
”Homological Algebra” is a collection of tools which are used throughout
most of math. When the composition of two linear maps of vector spaces (or,
more generally, abelian groups or modules) is zero, the image of the first map
lies within the kernel of the second. Homological algebra can be thought of as
the study of collections of vector spaces chained together with such maps, called
”differentials”. In particular, given such maps, we may take (for each map) the
quotient of the kernel of that map by the image of the previous; this gives the
homology or cohomology vector space (or group, or module). Somehow, in a
diverse range of cases, chaining together vector spaces with differentials gives
a way to express complicated and useful information from a particular math
problem; we can associate these chain complexes in various ways to geometric,
topological, number theoretical, and algebraic objects (among others), and each
express different pieces of information about those objects. Taking cohomology,
then, stratifies the (often intractable) data in these chain complexes into usable,
numerical data. Generally, the information captured by the chain complex is
contained in the specific details of the map, while taking homology yields vector
spaces who’s dimension often encodes useful information. This talk is designed
to be an intuitive discussion of homological algebra using vector spaces, and
introducing participants to some of the topics our colloquia will discuss.

<h3>
Smoothness of the Area Feature Function
</h3>
<h4>Hunter Golemon</h4>
Does the area of the level set of a real valued function of two real variables vary smoothly as the
function is moved around? In order to understand this question, we must first understand why we
would want to ask it. This question arose from studying zebrafish pattern formation, where they took
level sets of functions to generate patterns. They made a gene parameter space to vary the “genes”
of the fish, and then drew curves in this parameter space to separate regions containing spots from
stripes. However, to draw these curves, we needed the area of a level set to be smooth in the
function space. We will learn about the derivative as a linear map, the Implicit Function Theorem,
and then prove the area of a pattern varies smoothly in the infinite dimensional vector space of
functions.

<h3>
An Introduction to the Theory of p-Adic Numbers and Local Fields
</h3>
<h4>Zach Zobair</h4>
First introduced by Kurt Hensel in 1897, for a fixed prime p, the p-adic numbers are a completion of
the rational numbers, similar to the real numbers, but with respect to a different sense of
"distance" between two rational numbers. They are an example of a nonarchimedean local field. In
this talk we will begin by constructing the p-adic numbers and exploring some of their analytic,
algebraic, and topological properties, as well as remarking on how these properties manifest for
general local fields (<bf>Part 1</bf>). From there, we will shift perspectives and provide a geometric
intuition as to how, if one's goal is to solve a Diophantine equation, the p-adic numbers naturally
arise as a correct setting in which to do this (<bf>Part 2</bf>). For (<bf>Part 1</bf>), minimal prerequisites are
necessary. For full rigour some results will be stated in terms of fields, rings, and ideals, but
for a general understanding and intuition one can take these on faith. In (<bf>Part 2<bf>), we will assume
the basics of algebraic geometry (essentially just the definition of a locally ringed space).

<h3><a href="braids.pdf">An Introduction to Braid Groups</a></h3>
<h4>Olivia Hu</h4>
A braid in math is not too far from how it sounds — a collection of strands interlacing and
intertwining as they travel through paths in space. These braids are interesting creatures in their
own right. Some braids look complex, but are just one twist from being untied; other braids can look
simple, but are in truth much more obstinate. However, the study takes an unexpected turn upon
discovering braids, like numbers, can be multiplied and divided to create new braids: they form an
abstract structure called a group. By studying this group, we will realize that in studying braids,
we are actually also studying continuous functions on a disk.

<subsection>
<h3>CW-Complexes and Related Topics</h3>
<h4>Alice Marchant</h4>
Imagine building a tower. You have to start with some sort of foundation and then build a layer up
and then another layer on top of that and so on. A CW complex is a way that we can do this same
building process but for (almost) any space you can think of by just adding <em>n</em>-disks to a
previous part. We will explore in more detail how this construction works, some of the constraints
on it, and why it is such a useful construction in algebraic topology.
</subsection>
<subsection>
<h3><a href = "Conics.pdf">An Invitation to Algebraic Geometry</a></h3>
<h4>Skyler Marks</h4>
In high school algebra 1 and 2, we study the theory of single variable polynomial equations. In
	linear algebra, we study systems of linear equations, or polynomial equations with no exponents
	greater than 1. Algebraic Geometry combines these disciplines to study polynomial equations (in
	particular, their solutions) in many variables. This theory is useful as it is specific enough
	that we can compute with it, yet general enough that it applies to many problems we care about.
	The promised invitation will be extended by way of plane conics and cubics. After some
	definitions and preliminaries, we will review a family of classical results regarding plane
	conics (quadratic polynomials in two variables). We will begin by classifying conics into
	families who’s members are “alike”. We will then leverage this classification to study the
	intersections of two conics. Our conclusion to this first act will be a detailed discussion of
	the number of conics passing through n points in the plane, introducing Moduli spaces and
	projective space.

<h3><a href = "Weyl_Groups-1.pdf">Root Systems and Lie Groups</a></h3>
<h4>Zoe Siegelnickel</h4><br>
A root system is a collection of vectors definied over a Euclidian vector space with certain
	geometric properties. Some of the isometries
generated by these roots form a group called a Weyl group. These groups are
used extensively to study various symmetries. We will do a brief introduction
to Euclidean space, isometries, and root systems before discussing Weyl groups
and Weyl chambers and how they appear in Lie Theory.
</subsection>
<subsection>
<h3><a href = 'elliptic-curves.pdf'>Elliptic Curve Cryptography</a></h3>
<h4>Skyler Marks</h4>
The digital world is kept secure by cryptography. The idea behind most
modern cryptographic systems is that if I have a public number (some sort of
seed) and a secret number (usually called a private key) I can perform some
operation with them to generate a third number (which usually called a public
key). The public key is easy to generate by combining a seed and a private key,
but hard to generate any other way; this allows us to verify the authenticity of a
private key very easily. One such operation involves finding collinear points on
an elliptic curve, giving rise to elliptic curve cryptography. This talk introduced
elliptic curves over finite fields, explained how we can use their geometry to define
an appropriate operation, and touched on why this operation is appropriate
for cryptography. Slides for the talk can be found <a href="slides.pdf">here</a>.
