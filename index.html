<p>
Often, academic communities driven by individual personal interest and self-directed study are
designed for PhD students or professors. The Society of Mathematics at Boston University is such a
community, driven by personal interest and self-study, but curated by and for undergraduates. 
</p> <p>
In the
past, some confusion has been expressed at the fact that we don't hand out problem sets, require any
dues, or have any formal sign of membership. This is because our society seeks not to be a demanding
organization to boost a resumé or application, but to be a community where students have the space
to learn math they find challenging and fascenating.
