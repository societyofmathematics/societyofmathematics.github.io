<statement style="font-size: 110%">
<p>The Society of Mathematics is a social and academic group dedicated to
fostering mathematical discussion at a high level, creating a space for students to discuss their
mathematical passions, and exposing undergraduates of all levels and backgrounds to abstract
mathematics. </p>
<p>
We firmly believe that the ability to enjoy and engage with a mathematical conversation is primarily
dependent on curiosity and excitement, and merely facilitated by formal education. It is our goal to
ensure that everyone who is excited about and interested in discussing, learning, and doing
mathematics has access to a place where they can do so, outside the formal (and sometimes
restrictive) setting of a classroom. 
</p>

<p>
Weekly meetings form the backbone of our society. These are intentionally unstructured and informal;
we eat food, discuss math, and relax. We have found that building a community requires regular
meetings and conversations, but rewards those involved with a network, a safety net, and a group of
friends. In addition to this, we hold semiweekly colloquium talks. These are more formal events. The
talks are given by upper level undergraduates, for undergraduates; they are designed to be
accessible, and provide a view towards graduate classes and even research. These talks also provide
other upper level undergraduates the opportunity to branch outside of their concentrations and
expand their knowledge. 
<p>
Often, academic communities driven by individual personal interest and self-directed study are
designed for PhD students or professors. The Society of Mathematics is such a
community, driven by personal interest and self-study, but curated by and for undergraduates. In the
past, some confusion has been expressed at the fact that we don't hand out problem sets, require any
dues, or have any formal sign of membership. This is because our society seeks not to be a demanding
organization to boost a resumé or application, but to be a community where students have the space
to learn math they find challenging and fascinating. 
</p>
<p> We are currently being hosted by, and partially merging with, the
Boston University Mathematics Association (BUMA). </p>
