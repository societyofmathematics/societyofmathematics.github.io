  <h1>About the Society of Mathematics</h1>   
</header>

<statement style="font-size: 110%">
The aim of the Society of Mathematics is perhaps best evoked by the following passage from Virginia
Woolf's <em>A Room of One's Own</em>:
<blockquote>
	And thus by degrees was lit, half-way down the spine, which is the seat of the soul, not that
	hard little light which we call brilliance, as it pops in and out upon our lips, but the more
	profound, subtle, and subterranian glow which is the rich yellow flame of rational intercourse.
</blockquote>
The quote describes the intellectual and material environment of a dinner at the
fictional college, 'Oxbridge." The dinner, which she so venerates for being exemplary of 'rational
intercourse,' is flawed in that it is open only to a select few. We believe that academic discussion
should be an experience available to everyone, and we seek to provide that experience for all
undergraduates.
