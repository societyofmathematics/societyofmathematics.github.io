  <h1>About the Society of Mathematics at Boston University </h1>   
</header>

<statement style="font-size: 110%">
The aim of the Society of Mathematics is perhaps best evoked by the following passage from Virginia
Woolf's <em>A Room of One's Own</em>:
<blockquote>
	And thus by degrees was lit, half-way down the spine, which is the seat of the soul, not that
	hard little light which we call brilliance, as it pops in and out upon our lips, but the more
	profound, subtle, and subterranian glow which is the rich yellow flame of rational intercourse.
</blockquote>
The quote describes the intellectual and material environment of a dinner at the
fictional college, 'Oxbridge." The dinner, which she so venerates for being exemplary of 'rational
intercourse,' is flawed in that it is open only to a select few. We believe that academic discussion
should be an experience available to everyone, and we seek to provide that experience for all
undergraduates.
</p>

<p>
We firmly believe that the ability to enjoy and engage with a mathematical conversation is primarily
dependent on curiosity and excitement, and merely facilitated by formal education. It is our goal to
ensure that everyone who is excited about and interested in discussing, learning, and doing
mathematics has access to a place where they can do so, outside the formal (and sometimes
restrictive) setting of a classroom. 
</p>

<p>
Weekly meetings form the backbone of our society. These are intentionally unstructured and informal;
we eat food, discuss math, and relax. We have found that building a community requires regular
meetings and conversations, but rewards those involved with a network, a safety net, and a group of
friends. In addition to this, we hold semiweekly colloquium talks. These are more formal events. The
talks are given by upper level undergraduates, for undergraduates; they are designed to be
accessible, and provide a view towards graduate classes and even research. These talks also provide
other upper level undergraduates the opportunity to branch outside of their concentrations and
expand their knowledge.
